    <string name="description">
        The arch bridge across one of Japan\'s three stormiest currents in Hario Seto was opened in March, 2006.
        It runs parallel to Saikaibashi Bridge, which was built in 1955, and you can enjoy the view of the two arch bridges.
        The whirlpools of Seto and the cherry blossoms in the area are spectacular in the springtime.
